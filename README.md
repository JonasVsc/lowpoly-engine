<h1>Current State</h1>
<p>initial development phase and is not yet functional or implemented.</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of creating this game engine is not for general use but rather to cater specifically to low-poly games.
<br/><br/>
It will encompass everything from animation creation to world and character design. 
<br/><br/>
The engine will be highly niche-oriented to suit my personal preferences, as I'm simultaneously studying the topics involved. 
<br/><br/>
Hence, don't expect polished code standards here (not for now). 
<br/><br/>
Additionally, the engine will include support for networking and potentially integrate with Steam or Epic SDKs.</p>
